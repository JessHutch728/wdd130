        <p>Hi Everyone! My name is Jessica Hutchins and I live in the River Valley area of
            Arkansas. One of my favorite hobbies, as you can see, is learning how to safetly shoot guns. I especially
            enjoy my 9mm pistol. My newest adventure is learning Web Design and Development online throught BYUI. I am
            looking forward to seeing what career opportunities I have once I complete my degree.</p>

        <p>Above is an image of a sunrise over the beautiful ozark mountains here in Arkansas. It is known as "The
            Natural State". It is the only state in the United states that you can actually
            visit to dig for your own diamonds. Arkansas is the proud producer of half of the rice grown in
            the United States. It is also the birthplace of Walmart. Lastly, but not least, it has been
            named by U.S. News and World Report to be the number one most affordable state in the United States!" </p>
