        <p>Hi Everyone! My name is Jessica Hutchins and I live in the River Valley area of
            Arkansas. One of my favorite hobbies, as you can see, is learning how to safetly shoot guns. I especially
            enjoy my 9mm pistol. My newest adventure is learning Web Design and Development online throught BYUI. I am

        <p>Here are some interesting facts about the great state of Arkansas. It is known as "The Natural State". It is
            the only state in the United states that you can actually
            visit to dig for your own diamonds. Arkansas is the proud producer of half of the rice grown in the United
            States. Arkansas is also the birthplace of Walmart. Lastly, but not least, Arkansas has been named by U.S.
            News and World Report to be the number
            one most affordable state in the United States!" </p>
